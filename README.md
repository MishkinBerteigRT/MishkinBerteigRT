- 👋 Hi, I’m @MishkinBerteigRT - just call me "Mish" or "Mishkin"
- 👀 I’m interested in AI/ML, signal processing, and mathematics.
- 🌱 I’m currently training for three road cycling races: two 50km races and a time trial.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Agile engineering practices such as TDD and pair programming.
- 📫 How to reach me... probably Slack is best for this account, but I also have another GitHub account:
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I won a science fair project in 1988 on the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks.
